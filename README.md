Description:
Landing-Page

Approach:
This Landing Page is the first project that I'll build from scratch.

Learnings:
It is a hard path to create something from scratch. I learned several things after creating this.

1. I need to follow a strict naming conventions to avoid refactoring
2. My CSS file should always be grouped by content to avoid searching or double styling
3. Failing is a way to learn
